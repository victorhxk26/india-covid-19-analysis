There are a few steps that need to be done before the data analysis process commences using R. The first step revolves around data import, cleaning and pre-processing which includes loading the raw data set into the IDE and managing missing values. The second step is exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the data set and the variable distribution through visualization. The third step is data manipulation which includes creating new variables, changing column names and sub-setting columns of interest. The final step is data analysis which includes descriptive and correlational analysis and showing relevant outputs through statistical tables.
